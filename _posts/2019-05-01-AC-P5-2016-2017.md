# Analysis and Some Conclusion of 2016-2017 P5 & 2017-2018 P6  


## Foreword
1. The target of this report is the students of 2016-2017 P5 & 2017-2018 P6.  
1. There is no description of data process and source code of SAS. if you want to check, please click this link.  
1. Currently, there are just some simple report and diagram base on a part of statistical indicators, furthermore, some conclusion together the teacher's opinions were attached.  
1. Later, if time is enough, I will add more comprehensive statistics.


## 1. Base on Different Classes in Each Grade

There are 2 classes in 2016-2017 P5, which totally contain around 50 students.
After they upgraded to P6, 50 students was mixed randomly and devided into 2 classes in 2017-2018 P6.  

### 1.1 Class Comparision in P5 base on Mean

**Conclusion:**  
  
1. The mean of Class P5-2 score is distinctly higher than that of Class P5-1.
1. however the stand deviation (which quantify the amount of variation of a set of data values) of P5-2 is greater than that of P5-1 as well. namely the gap between good score and poor score in P5-2 is more obvious.
1. the incresement of STD of P5-2 is gradually higher for each term. namely in each terms, the gap of score in P5-2 was growing.
1. the STD of term1 in P5-1 is stil not quite big, however,  from term2, the STD is growing up obviously (the pace of increment is lower than that of P5-2). 
1. in summary, the means score P5-1 is tiny lower than P5-2, but more stable, and uniform.


### 1.2 Class Comparision in P6 base on Mean

**Conclusion:**  
  
1. Except Term 2 in Grade 6, the mean of Class P6-1 score is little bit of higher than that of Class P6-2.
1. in summary, the situation is happened to reverse with that in last academic year(when P5)

## 2. Base on All Students performance in Each Grade
Different with the above one, the statistics in this chapter will be base on all students performance in each grade.
It will analyze the level and some statistical indicators base on all student score.

### 2.1 Overall Stat of P5 & P6 with box

**Conclusion:**  

During P5, the deviation was more and more obvious followed the development of terms.
The bias of mean of all terms in P5 and P6 is not large.
the performance of P6 is worse than that P5.

### 2.2 P5 Score Distribution

**Conclusion:**  

followed the term forward, the good score(above 92.5) became more and more, meanwhile the percent of lower score(lower than 72.5) almost didnt changed, namely variation is more and more bigger.

### 2.3 P6 Score Distribution

**Conclusion:**  

Variation is smaller compared with that in P5. Meanwhile as it was displayed in sub-chapter 2.1, we can know the overall of P6 score is worse than P5.  
(It seems like student in P6 dont like to study any more....)

### 2.3 P5 & P6 Score Distribution

**Conclusion:**  

Good is good, worse is worse....

## 3. Base on each Students in Two Academic Years

### 3.1 Most unstable score

**Conclusion:**  
There are some students whose score of 8 terms in P5 & P6 fluctuates with an obvious range, however their mean score is not high, even lower. That means student sometimes got a high score, but sometimes score plummets, and finally the mean score is not so high.


### 3.2 Most stable score

**Conclusion:**  

good ones are always good, worse ones remain worse.

## 4. Base on Trend-featured Student in Two Academic Years

### 4.1 Trend of going up

in the previous article, I alread introduced the method and get the thumbnail of figure like this:

![](https://cl.ly/af0be6bbb7fe/Image%2525202019-06-18%252520at%2525203.42.10%252520%2525E4%2525B8%25258B%2525E5%25258D%252588.png)

then we can take the obvious ones to analyze using the following code:

```
PROC SGPANEL DATA=ss_16_17.tempT4series_goup(where=(name in ("GEOFFREY MIKHAEL","JEREMY JERO","JAMES DYLAN IRWANTO"))) noautolegend;	PANELBY trend name  / NOVARNAME COLUMNS= 2 ONEPANEL;series x=term y=score1 / GROUP=name datalabel;COLAXIS grid; run;```

![](https://cl.ly/47c80b99e006/Image%2525202019-06-20%252520at%25252011.38.20%252520%2525E4%2525B8%25258A%2525E5%25258D%252588.png)

**Conclusion:**  

* from the above figure, we can see JAMES among these 3 studnets is the one who improve greatly and become stable.
* both of GEOFFREY and JEREMY have great improvement, however GEOFFREY had the stable improvement in P5 and his score fluctuated in P6. JEREMY had the opposite situaation.


### 4.2 Trend of going down

After I chose the 3 typical featured students, the figures are shown as below:

![](https://cl.ly/51b770e59e41/Image%2525202019-06-20%252520at%25252011.40.54%252520%2525E4%2525B8%25258A%2525E5%25258D%252588.png)

**Conclusion:** 

* NELSON and REINALDO has the similiar situation in P6 phase: after enter P6, the score plummeted. This feature was shown on REINALDO more obviously, as his P5 score was in the range of middle above.
* LIONEL's score were going down from the first term in P5 and almost touched the lowest score - 70. in P6, seems like he wasn't will to study any more, namely giving up.

### 4.3 Scores fluctuated greatly

in this part, I chose 9 student whose score fluctuated greatly in the period of P5 and P6.

![](https://cl.ly/95dcc1ac207b/Image%2525202019-06-20%252520at%25252011.44.31%252520%2525E4%2525B8%25258A%2525E5%25258D%252588.png)

I concluded these following situation from the above figures:  

1. the one had great improvement in P5, but plummeted in P6. like KENZIE, KIMBERLY and ALIEEN.
1. the one had mediocre scores in P5, then raise up in P6 and plummeted soon. like WINSTON, JENSON.
1. the score likes roller coaster, up and down alternatively. like AILEEN and HADRIAN.
