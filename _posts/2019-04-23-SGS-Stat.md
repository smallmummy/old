# Students Score Statistics and Anylysis Base on My Teaching Career with SAS

<br/>
## Foreword
I've been working a mandarin teacher for 5 years. During the period, lots of data of students scores which are sutiable for analysis were accumulated.   
In this article, I will perform the statistics and analysis via software SAS. In the last part, lots of diagram will be displayed and some conclusion will come out, which be valiadated with my teaching experience.  

ps:  
Besides a mandarin teaching at school, I am IT workman as well. Hence the original data for statistics and the skill of using SAS software existed, I cannot miss this chance for practice, especially which was relavent tightly with my life.

<br/>
## 1.Original Data Overview

### 1.1 Grade which I tought
 
Academic Year | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3  
--------|--------|--------|--------  
2014-2015|Primary 5|Primary 6|Year 7
2015-2016|Primary 5|Primary 6|Year 7
2016-2017|Primary 4|Primary 5|
2017-2018|Primary 5|Primary 6|
2018-2019|Primary 5|Primary 6|

There are 4 terms in an academic year, however I dont think the data of an academic year are enough for analyzing some statistical indicators, furthermore there are some factors influences, such as the original data for the first second academic are simple and uncompleted. As a conclusion, I decide only perform the statistics on these following grade and academic years:

* 2014-2015 P5 & 2015-2016 P6  
* 2016-2017 P5 & 2017-2018 P6  
* 2016-2017 P4 & 2017-2018 P5 & 2018-2019 P6  

Note:
There are 3 rows above which has enough and completed orginal data for me to perform, and the students in the same row,during the different academic year are some student.  
For instance, the 3rd row:  
>2016-2017 P4 & 2017-2018 P5 & 2018-2019 P6  

the students who were in P4 at 2016-2017, after upgraded into the new grade, are the same student with P5 at 2017-2018. Then same for P6 at 2018-2019.  

### 1.2 Mix Student After Upgrade into a New Grade
Although the student after upgrade into a new grade are some with the previous in old grade (the transfer out and transfer in student and suspension student are the changes), but the students will mixed and assign to new classes in the new grade randomly.  

like the simple illustration in the following:

students | P5 Class 
-------|-------
A|P5-1
B|P5-1
C|P5-2
D|P5-2

after mixed and new assignment in P6 grade:

students | P5 Class 
-------|-------
A|P6-1
B|P6-2
C|P6-1
D|P6-2


to the certain extents, this is a good mechaism and good for student and school on some certain aspects, such as it will let students make more new good students and rejuvenate some classed and so on.  
howevere it also generates some disadvantages and it will be display later. Lets see it in the following chapters.


ps:  
school manegement stated the assigement after mix in the grade is base on random, as I as the one who was involved, I was clear about the fact is not like what they mention, later it will be displayed in the statistics report and diagram.  
It happened to validate some conclusion. :)  

### 1.3 Stat Items
Each term in an academic year contains:

1. Dictation Score  
Dictation in mandarin test which require student write down the mandarin characters and coresponding english meaning and some short sentence only, can indicate the level of mandarin characters writing on some extent. however high score of dictation sometimes might not express student grab how to use those mandarin words in practical sence.  
After every single lesson finished, the dictation would be executed.

2. Daily Performance Score
Subject teacher will evaluate this score base on the student daily performance, such as respone to question in class, whether chat or disturb others, whether submit homework on time, the quality of homework and etc.  
This score is subjective on different teachers, and also teacher to different students, so weight of this score cannot be too high to render the statistical indicators.  
Each term has a daily performance score.

3. Unit Test Score 
A unit is composed several lessons, generally 2 or 3 lessons. The unit test score express the extent how student grab the knowledge in a unit, and was generated from a unit test paper which consist of various kinds of question, can evaluate student level objective.  
Each term has at least one, sometimes more than one unit test.

4. Term Test Score
Every team test paper was composed by paper1 - essay, and paper2 - which consist of various kinds of questoin. As a extra, Term 2 and Term 4 test paper have oral test which could evaluate the oral ability of students.
Each team has a term test score.

This is a sample of one class original data:

#### 1.4 Some Notes

the passing score is 70. if the student got the score lower than 70, means not passed,need a remedial. No matter how many score he or she got in the remedial, the final score recorded in the excel file is 70, however the ceil will be remarked with a distinct colour.
